CrashRebound — buy alts after a -25% drawdown from rolling 30d high

Paradigm: other (counter-trend / drawdown-rebound)
Hypothesis: AltsBollBreak's r0-r4 trajectory established that breakout
            paradigms on alts have structural winter fragility — every
            defense (1d position filter, stoploss, slope filter) cut bull
            profit while only partially silencing winter. The opposite
            structural exposure is interesting: a counter-trend strategy
            that ENTERS on drawdowns. Crashes happen in every regime
            (bull pullbacks, winter capitulations, recovery shakeouts);
            the rebound size varies but the directional edge is generally
            positive on liquid majors. Trigger: 1h close < 30d-rolling-max
            × 0.75 (i.e., 25% off 30-day peak) AND 1h RSI(14) < 35
            (oversold confirmation — don't catch knives mid-fall, wait
            for a stretch). Exit: 1h close > 1h SMA50 (mean-reversion
            target, halfway-back-to-prior-trend). Universe: alts only
            (SOL, AVAX, BNB) — alts have larger drawdowns than majors,
            and the v0.4.0 surfacing was that BTC/ETH have less
            mean-reverting structure. test_timeranges spans bull/winter/
            recovery/full to make the cross-regime claim falsifiable.
            Equal-weight sizing.
Parent: root (replaces AltsBollBreak which was killed at r5 after 5
        rounds of failed winter defenses)
Created: pending — fill in after first commit
Status: active
Uses MTF: no (1h-only on entry/exit; 30d max needs 720 bars warmup)
